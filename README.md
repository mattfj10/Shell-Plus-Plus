# What is Shell-Plus-Plus (Shell++)
This is a personal project of mine that I've wanted to do for awhile. I've always been intrigued by the concept of shell interpreters, so I figured, why not make my own? I don't have very huge plans for this project, nor do I have any expectations of it being phenomenal, this is mostly a for fun project as a way for me to understand systems programming on the Linux platform. Development will begin with it being a BASH clone, and then I plan to listen to the community and see if I can't find any desired features that I'd be tempted to implement.

# Why program it in C++, why not in C?
This was a tough choice for me, as I really love C and I've wanted to undertake a large scale project in C, but I also wanted to undertake one in C++, and I'd honestly like to leverage the OOP functionalities of C++ while developing this shell. C++ is definitely slower than C, but I'd love to make a Shell in C++ and leverage the object oriented functionalities, as I feel it would be fun.
